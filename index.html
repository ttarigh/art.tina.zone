          <p>
            This is a little install I did for @pixelmouthnyc called ‚ÄúA rose for @Emily7213_lol‚Äù

            It‚Äôs an immersive viewing experience that dynamically switches between different real-time live streams worldwide while physically encapsulating you in the soft-sculpture. The portals transition between remote sea cameras, zoo animals, random backyards, ASMR, porn cams, MIT‚Äôs cafeteria, bomb watches in Gaza, UN meetings, mukbang channels, urban city streets, game shows, stock watches, and so SO much more. It also featured a security camera watching the viewer from a location within the gallery. (Check out the video from inside the portal)

            This project highlights both the interconnectedness of our digital-age existence and the pervasive nature of modern surveillance. You are the observer and the observed. Thanks so much @tench.nology for getting me involved. It was such an honor and the show was fabulous ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüôè

          <h2>SuperVitamin</h2>
          <p>
            My inspirations for ‚ÄúSuperVitamin‚Äù were: 1) an ex who would take a bunch of supplements at the same time (like a handful of 20 pills, AT ONCE!!) and 2) a time period where I was completely enthralled with online manifestation videos.

            To manifest my dream job, I spent nearly an hour each morning listening to three back-to-back videos. Patience isn‚Äôt my virtue, so why not binge all these good vibes at once? That curiosity plunged me into YouTube‚Äôs manifestation rabbit hole, where you can manifest anything. Forget just the dream job‚Äîhow about changing your eye color, winning the lottery, or nailing a backflip? The possibilities are endless, with countless frequencies and soothing voices guiding the way.

            Use this tool as a menu, pick out everything you want to manifest and listen to the cacophony of your every desire.

            After a friend with covid jokingly told me to "worship her through
            the screen," I thought about how I could make a shrine-like website
            for her. I notortiously make websites and art projects for the
            people in my life, so this was a fun challenge. This is my first
            Node.js application! After uploading a photo, users generate a link
            to their custom shrines, with buttons allowing you to worship them
            harder and harder. This custom link is sharable with other people,
            so they can worship you as well.

            WIP, two characters who are in love that speak to each other across
            the browser. This is an experiment with dialogue and animation.
            Current fixes needed: the speech is off. I realized you cannot have

            I stopped posting casual selfies of myself on instagram once it
            started turning into a page where I shared my freelance work and
            personal projects. I'm not exactly sure why. The humorous side of me
            likes to think it is because it is too easily accessible, and most
            people do not deserve my awesome selfies. This led to "Engage with
            Me," a series of steps you must complete before being deemed worthy
            enough for an old picture of me.

            After discovering the trend of "deinfluencing," I decided to take a
            stab at the consumerism problem. I noticed that because of how
            convienient it has become to order things online, we are consuimg
            much more than we need to. My simple solution to this is a chrome
            extension I aptly named "Stop Buying Things." By detecting that you
            are on a shopping cart page, the pop-up turns your browser window
            red for a few seconds, then reminds you of its simple creed: STOP
            BUYING THINGS! In the few seconds where your browser is totally red,
            it will allow you to take a deep breath before truly considering if
            you need to buy anything.

            What does the application do? What is its purpose?
          </p>
          <p>
            This application is a additional skill practice program built for
            english-speaking 2nd graders. Its purpose is to help students
            improve their additional skills by encouraging them to get multiple
            answers in a row. Users answer the displayed arithemic question,
            which increases in difficulty every level. Users submit their answer
            by pressing the submit button, or pressing the enter key on their
            keyboard. If the user answers correctly, a new problem will be
            random generated.
          </p>
          <p>
            The number of currently consecutive answers is stored, and it is
            displayed under "Current Streak" on the webpage. The users highest
            streak for the session is also displayed, which is reset when the
            page is refreshed/ a new session starts.
          </p>
          <p>
            For every correctly answered question, the screen displays "Correct!
            Great Job!" with an accompanying image of the original avatar, Mathy
            the Adventure Cat, randoming displaying 1 of 3 positive emotions.
            Every 10 correct consecutive answers is rewarded with unlocking a
            new background.
          </p>
          <p>
            When users enter incorrectly, the current streak is reset to 0, and
            the question will not change until it is answer correctly. Mathy the
            Adventure Cat is displayed as having a pensive, thinking face.
          </p>
          <p>
            When users need help, they can press the help button in the top
            right of the div container. This alerts the user of some ways to
            help them solve the problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            For users who have sight impairments or struggle with dyscalculia,
            there is a speech-to-text toggle button displayed under the current
            level.
